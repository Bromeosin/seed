          <p>Since moving to Brighton we've grown our company considerably. New team members have joined Seed and we've had the privilege of working closely with some of the UK's leading brands.</p>
          <p>We’re a mixed bunch at Seed; coffee-junkies, early risers, night owls, health fanatics, tech geeks. And although we’re different, we’re all open-minded, passionate about digital marketing and fundamentally respect one another.</p>
